If you have a very large table in MySQL and you need to delete all the data from it. Instead of using the DELETE syntax or&nbsp;DELETE FROM tablename; It is best to use the&nbsp;TRUNCATE syntax.  This will delete all data in the table very quickly. In MySQL the table is actually dropped and recreated, hence the speed of the query.  [bash]mysql\>&nbsp;TRUNCATE TABLE tablename;  Query OK, 0 rows affected (10.34 sec)[/bash]

- _Note:&nbsp;The number of deleted rows for MyISAM tables returned is zero; for INNODB it returns the actual number deleted._
