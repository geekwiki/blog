There is a great tutorial over at IT World on using&nbsp;**[lftp](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/lftp.yar.ru "lftp")**,&nbsp;a lesser known command line FTP/HTTP client. &nbsp; This versatile client has been around since the mid 90's, but gets less visibility these days compared to curl or wget. &nbsp;There are many great features in lftp, such as SSL support, recursive transfers, and even the ability to put a running transfer in the background. &nbsp;If you want to give it a try, you can install it straight from your package repository on most Linux distributions.
