What is _**[Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/)**_?..

> Conky is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays any information on your desktop. Conky is licensed under the GPL and runs on Linux and BSD. I stumbled upon Conky when I was setting up my new laptop with Linux Mint, I was looking for the Linux equivalent to [GeekTool for Mac](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/). While Conky is much more complicated than GeekTool is, it's much more powerful and provides a wide range of options, all very customizable.  [caption id="attachment\_1800" align="alignright" width="300"][![Conky Setup and configured on a Debian OS](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/conky-screenshot-300x168.png)](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/conky-screenshot.png) Conky Setup and configured on a Debian OS[/caption]  Here's a screenshot of my desktop to the right, after I got Conky setup and configured correctly... **To Install Conky**... It's pretty basic, you can install it via APT...  [bash]sudo apt-get install conky[/bash] **Customizing Conky** can get a little tricky. Start by creating a ~/.conkyrc file, which may or may not exist after you install Conky, (I don't think it gets created, but I don't remember for sure. If it's not there, then Conky will assume default settings for everything.. which is pretty ugly). Here's my custom Conky configuration file: [Conky Configuration File](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/conky_config.txt)  At the top of the file are the settings for the Conky application iself, (As opposed to the display content/settings). Everything prior to the line that just contains " **TEXT**". [Heres](http://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html) a page on Conkys website that reference each of the setting variables, and what they represent. Most of these settings are pretty self explanatory, but be sure to poke around a bit just to be sure. **Note** : You will notice that if you edit the ~/.conkyrc file while Conky is running, then save it, Conky will automatically reload with the new settings.  [divider]
## Examples
 These are some creative examples of how customizable Conky can be. [![Conky_Example-11](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-11-300x225.png)](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-11.png)[![Conky_Example-15](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-15-300x187.png)](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-15.png)[![Conky_Example-12](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-12-300x168.jpg)](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-12.jpg)[![Conky_Example-13](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-13-300x187.jpg)](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-13.jpg)[![Conky_Example-11](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-111-300x225.png)](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-111.png)[![Conky_Example-11](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-11-300x225.png)](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/Conky_Example-11.png)
