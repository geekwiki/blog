Are you like me and never actually go into google voice to mark them as read as you do email? I just look at the email that I get in my gmail box and look at the transcription. Hardly ever actually log into the google.com/voice site.  Well with the new Jelly Bean voice integration into SMS and Call log, all those "missed" calls are annoying. And Googles web interface would only allow you to mark 10 read at a time. (Take WAYYYY to long to do the 1600+ that I had). Sooo, as any nerd would do... there has to be a better way right?  Well, I'm not much of a Python person but this might turn me onto some cool ideas and things you can do with Google Voice and Python in general.  Here is how you can mark all you unread msg's as read. No matter how many you have.

- First Install the packages you need.
_From Site:&nbsp;[http://sphinxdoc.github.com/pygooglevoice/install.html#setups](http://www.linuxdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/install.html#setups "http://sphinxdoc.github.com/pygooglevoice/install.html#setups")_  [bash]$ yum install python python-setuptools $ sudo easy\_install simplejson $ sudo easy\_install -U pygooglevoice[/bash]
- Next, you must make a change to the LOGIN value of the settings.py file in the pygooglevoice egg package.
- Its the settings.py file: In my case it was located here: /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pygooglevoice-0.5-py2.6.egg/settings.py

[python]LOGIN = https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=grandcentral[/python] 

- Now create a simple script
- Courtesy of this guy:&nbsp;[http://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/10105](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/10105 "http://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/10105")
 [python] from googlevoice import Voice,util voice = Voice() voice.login('YOUR USERNAME', 'YOUR PASSWORD')  while True : folder = voice.search('is:unread') if folder.totalSize break util.print\_(folder.totalSize) for message in folder.messages: util.print\_(message) message.mark(1) [/python] 

- Then simply execute the script and save yourself HOURS of time!
 [bash]python your\_script\_name.py[/bash]
