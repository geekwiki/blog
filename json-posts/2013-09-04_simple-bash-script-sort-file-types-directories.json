Often times I find myself needing to sort a lot of files into certain directories, for example I have downloaded a lot of free ebooks and a lot of them have different file types such as epub, mobi, azw, or even pdf and I want to keep them sorted into their respective folders to make it easier to pull up particular file types. To quickly do this I wrote a very simple and basic bash script that will allow me to do this.   [bash] \<pre\> #!/bin/bash  array=( epub mobi pdf azw ) bookdir="/books" sourcedir="/home/user/"  for i in "${array[@]}" do echo "Moving books with file type: $i" find $sourcedir -type f -iname "\*.$i" -print0 | xargs -0 -I file mv -v "file" "$bookdir/$i/" chown -R apache.apache "$bookdir/$i" done  [/bash]  All it does is look for particular files that end in the extension that is in the array, and then move them into the bookdir/extension folder. So as an example if I had file1.epub in the /home/user/ directory, it would find that file and then move it to /books/epub.  This is a very basic script, and is just here to help people get the idea of how to automate tasks that you would normally do manually.
