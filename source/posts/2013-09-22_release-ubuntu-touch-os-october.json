There has been a lot of interest in the Linux community about the upcoming release of the Ubuntu Touch OS. &nbsp;In August the **[Ubuntu Edge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQLe3iIMN7k)** crowd sourcing campaign didn't reach its goal of raising $32 million dollars in a month. &nbsp;What it did raise was over $12.8 million dollars and a lot of interest from the phone and tablet makers. &nbsp;The word was finally put out that it will be **[released along side Ubuntu 13.10 on October 17th](https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/msg04142.html)**. &nbsp;You can get a good idea of what Canonical's vision for their mobile OS is from the [tablet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h384z7Ph0gU "tablet") and &nbsp;[phone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpWHJDLsqTU "phone")&nbsp;videos they released earlier in the year.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h384z7Ph0gU  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpWHJDLsqTU
